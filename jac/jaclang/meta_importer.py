# Bootstrap bytecode cache
#
# Seed-tier .jac files are transpiled by jac0 on every invocation.  Caching
# the resulting bytecode avoids ~200 ms of repeated work when the sources
# haven't changed.  The cache lives at ~/.cache/jac/jir/bootstrap/ as plain
# marshalled code objects: the cache *filename* already encodes a digest over
# the Python version, the jac0 transpiler, and all source/impl contents, so no
# in-file header or validation is needed.  The directory is resolved by the
# pure-Python `jaclang.jac0core.cache_paths` (importable here, before the JIR
# Jac modules are bootstrapped), so it shares one platform-resolution rule with
# `jaclang.compiler.driver.jir`; the cache *key*, however, stays independent of that
# module's `compute_module_key` since it must work before the seed tier compiles.
