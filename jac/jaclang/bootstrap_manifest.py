"""The declared bootstrap (jac0) seed set.

Tier membership used to be a path test ("is the file under jac0core/?"),
which coupled *where a module lives* to *which compiler compiles it* and
let the bootstrap directory accrete everything the seed-visible code
touched. This manifest is now the single authority: a .jac file is
compiled by the jac0 seed transpiler (and flagged ``"bootstrap": true``
at seal time) iff it is covered here. Directory entries end with ``/``
and cover their whole subtree; file entries name one module. Paths are
POSIX-style, relative to the ``jaclang`` package directory.

This module must stay pure Python with no jaclang imports: the meta
importer consults it before any .jac module can load. CI checks that
every covered module actually compiles under jac0 and that no seed
module imports outside the seed set at module scope (a hoisted import
deadlocks bootstrap) -- see scripts/check_seed_manifest.py.

Moving a seed module is a two-line change: git mv the file, update its
entry here. Entries that do not exist on disk fail loudly at boot.
