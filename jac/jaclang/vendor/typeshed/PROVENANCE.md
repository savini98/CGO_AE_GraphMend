# Vendored typeshed (stdlib stubs only)

The Python standard-library type stubs from typeshed. They are NOT committed:
`stdlib/` is gitignored and rebuilt at the pinned commit by the `fetch-typeshed`
subcommand of the payload tool (`jaclang/payload/`), which `build.zig` runs as
its `fetch-typeshed` step so the `jac` binary bundles the stubs. Only this
file, `PIN`, `TARBALL_SHA256`, and `LICENSE` are tracked.

Integrity: the payload tool downloads the GitHub tarball for the pinned commit
and verifies the **decompressed tar's** sha256 against `TARBALL_SHA256` (git's
`archive` output is content-stable for a commit), so a swapped tarball cannot
slip in -- the same guarantee git's content-addressing gave the old `git fetch`.

Third-party stubs are NOT shipped: install the matching `types-*` package
yourself (`jac install types-foo`); it is resolved via PEP 561 `<pkg>-stubs`
from the project venv.

To bump:
1. Put the new commit SHA in `PIN`.
2. Get the new hash with the payload tool's `typeshed-sha` subcommand (run
   `jaclang.payload.cli` with `typeshed-sha <commit>`; `build.zig` drives the
   same tool for its fetch steps) and write the printed value into
   `TARBALL_SHA256`.
3. Update the Commit line above and commit `PIN`, `TARBALL_SHA256`, `PROVENANCE.md`.
