    This class copied code from [`RobertaModel`] and overwrote standard self-attention with longformer self-attention

    the Long-Document Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150) by Iz Beltagy, Matthew E. Peters, and Arman Cohan.
    Longformer self-attention combines a local (sliding window) and global attention to extend to long documents
    without the O(n^2) increase in memory and compute.

    The self-attention module `LongformerSelfAttention` implemented here supports the combination of local and global
    attention but it lacks support for autoregressive attention and dilated attention. Autoregressive and dilated
    attention are more relevant for autoregressive language modeling than finetuning on downstream tasks. Future
    release will add support for autoregressive attention, but the support for dilated attention requires a custom CUDA
    kernel to be memory and compute efficient.
